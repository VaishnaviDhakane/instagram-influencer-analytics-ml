# 📸 Instagram Influencer Analytics & Impact Prediction  

## 📌 Project Overview  
The Instagram Influencer Analytics & Impact Prediction project is a data science and machine learning initiative focused on analyzing Instagram influencer data to understand engagement behavior and predict an influencer’s overall impact. The goal of this project is to move beyond follower count and use data-driven metrics to evaluate true influencer performance.

The project involves cleaning and preprocessing raw Instagram data, engineering meaningful engagement-related features, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building a machine learning model to predict influencer impact. This approach helps brands and marketers make informed decisions while selecting influencers for campaigns.
